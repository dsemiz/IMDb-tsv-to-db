# IMDb-tsv-to-db

This project uses BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Sqlalchemy to scrape, download, and convert the IMDb database (compressed into several different tables and formatted as .tsv) into a single SQLite formatted database. 

The runtime is fairly long due to the size of the downloads, it may take up to 40 minutes on a slow internet connection.
